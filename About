ðŸŒŽ Fighting Amazon Deforestation with Machine Learning & Satellite Data

I recently built a machine learning pipeline using Google Earth Engine and open satellite data to detect and predict Amazon deforestation, aiming to support conservation efforts and data-driven decision-making.

My workflow included:

Data sourcing: Leveraging Google Earth Engine and open datasets (Hansen Global Forest Change, Landsat, SRTM).
Feature engineering: Creating indices like NDVI and NBR, and extracting elevation data.
Model training & evaluation: Using Random Forests to classify forest/non-forest, handling class imbalance, and evaluating with accuracy and confusion matrices.
Visualization: Mapping predicted deforestation risk and analyzing trends over time.
Key results:

Generated maps highlighting areas at risk of deforestation.
Demonstrated a workflow that can be adapted for other regions or conservation challenges.
