3. Portfolio & Storytelling Tips for LinkedIn
Describe the Problem:
“I built a machine learning pipeline using Google Earth Engine and open satellite data to detect and predict Amazon deforestation, aiming to support conservation efforts.”

Showcase Your Workflow:

Data sourcing (Earth Engine, open datasets)
Feature engineering (indices, elevation, etc.)
Model training and evaluation (accuracy, ROC, etc.)
Visualization of results (maps, confusion matrix, feature importance)
Share Results:

Maps of predicted deforestation risk.
Insights (e.g., “Model detects 92% of clearings >1ha with <5% false positives”)
Link to your GitHub repo and a sample notebook.
Invite Collaboration:
“Open to feedback and collaboration with researchers, NGOs, and data scientists passionate about environmental protection!”
