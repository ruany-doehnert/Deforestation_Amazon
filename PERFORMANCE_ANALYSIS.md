Business Impact Analysis for Brazil Forest Conservation 🇧🇷

Critical Metrics Ranking

🥇 Forest Recall: 90% (MOST CRITICAL)

- What it measures: Of all actual forest areas, how many did we correctly identify?
- Business Impact: Catches 90% of real forests - critical for early deforestation detection
- Environmental Consequence: Missing forests = irreversible biodiversity loss
- Economic Impact: Prevention is cheaper than restoration

🥈 Non-Forest Precision: 89% (VERY IMPORTANT)

- What it measures: Of areas predicted as non-forest, how many are actually non-forest?
- Business Impact: 89% accuracy means low false alarms for conservation teams
- Operational Benefit: Efficient resource allocation, reduced wasted field investigations

🥉 Forest Precision: 86% (IMPORTANT)

- What it measures: Of areas predicted as forest, how many are actually forest?
- Business Impact: Controls false forest alerts, maintains team efficiency

📊 Non-Forest Recall: 85% (MONITORING)

- What it measures: Of all actual non-forest areas, how many did we correctly identify?
- Business Impact: Important for tracking restoration success and land use changes

Why Forest Recall is Most Critical 🚨
- Environmental Consequences
- Missing deforestation = Irreversible biodiversity loss
- Climate impact = Increased CO₂ emissions

Legal violations = Non-compliance with environmental regulations

Economic Impact

- Early detection enables effective intervention
- Late detection often means it's too late to act
- Prevention costs are significantly lower than restoration

Time Sensitivity

- Deforestation is irreversible in the short term
- Real-time monitoring is crucial for conservation success
- Early warning systems save more forest than reactive approaches
